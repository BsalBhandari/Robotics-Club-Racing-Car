# Robotics-Club-Racing-Car
This repository contains the source code for an Arduino Racing Car project developed by the Robotics Club. The car was controlled using Bluetooth and was programmed in C++. 

## Project Overview:
As the Vice-President of the Robotics Club, I led a team of 6 members in the production and development of an Arduino Racing Car. The goal of the project was to create a car that could be controlled through Bluetooth using an Arduino board.

## Key Features: 
1. Control of the car using Bluetooth and an Arduino board
2. Utilization of C++ for software development
3. Original design that stood out among competitors in both undergraduate and graduate level competitions
4. Despite not winning the competition, the car received compliments from competitors for its unique and non-copied design

## Technical Skills Utilized:
1. C++ programming
2. Bluetooth communication
3. Arduino board programming

## Challenges and Solutions:
-During the development process, there was a bug that caused the car to not turn while it was speeding, and when it was turning, it was not speedy. After extensive debugging, the issue was found to be a faulty use of an operator in the code. The issue was resolved and the car was able to successfully complete its runs in the competition.
