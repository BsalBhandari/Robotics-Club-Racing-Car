# Robotics-Club-Racing-Car
This repository contains the source code for an Arduino Racing Car project developed by the Robotics Club. The car was controlled using Bluetooth and was programmed in C++. 

Project Overview:
As the Vice-President of the Robotics Club, I led a team of 6 members in the production and development of an Arduino Racing Car. The goal of the project was to create a car that could be controlled through Bluetooth using an Arduino board.

Key Features:
-Control of the car using Bluetooth and an Arduino board
-Utilization of C++ for software development
-Original design that stood out among competitors in both undergraduate and graduate level competitions
-Despite not winning the competition, the car received compliments from competitors for its unique and non-copied design

Technical Skills Utilized:
-C++ programming
-Bluetooth communication
-Arduino board programming

Challenges and Solutions:
-During the development process, there was a bug that caused the car to not turn while it was speeding, and when it was turning, it was not speedy. After extensive debugging, the issue was found to be a faulty use of an operator in the code. The issue was resolved and the car was able to successfully complete its runs in the competition.
